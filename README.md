# Optimizing PostgreSQL for Performance in Big Data Applications

This research aims to enhance the performance and user experience of PostgreSQL databases for big data applications through correct database design, indexing strategies, and server hardware tuning.

### Research Project Highlights

- Literature review.
- Technology review.
- Implementation of the findings from the literature review to answer the following research questions:
  - What are the most effective indexing strategies to improve query performance in PostgreSQL for big
    data applications?
  - How can optimization techniques enhance PostgreSQL performance for complex queries in large
    datasets?  
  - How do hardware resources and caching strategies impact PostgreSQL performance in big data
    environments?
